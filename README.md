In this project, we implemented quantum algorithms that solve the collision problem.

Implementations:
1. Quantum searching real unstructured databases using Grover for 2 qubits
2. Manual Black-Box Creation BHT Algorithm with Grover for 3 qubits
3. Generalized BHT Algorithm with Grover for 3 qubits
